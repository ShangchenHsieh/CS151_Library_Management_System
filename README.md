## Project Overview

The CS151 Library Management System was developed to address the local library's need for digitizing their book collection, aimed at facilitating user interaction with the library catalog and reducing the workload on librarians. This web-accessible application offers a user-friendly interface for efficient library management. This system also uses a "persitant" database by implementing JSON files as its database. As a result, the data persists after the application is clased.

## Features & Functionality

The system empowers librarians with complete administrative control over library items, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can seamlessly perform actions such as checking out, returning, adding, deleting, and updating various library items, including books, theses, video tapes, etc.

## Solution Implementation

Built using Java and Java Swing, the interactive user interface enhances user and librarian experiences. The system enables a range of operations critical for library management, fostering improved efficiency and a superior user experience.
